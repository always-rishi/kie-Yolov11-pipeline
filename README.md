## 🎯 What Are We Doing?

Our objective is to build a robust, automated pipeline capable of extracting structured ingredient lists from product images. Real-world product packaging often contains complex backgrounds, varied lighting, and distorted text. To tackle this, we are developing a multi-stage system that first detects where the text is located, accurately transcribes that text, and then uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to semantically identify and format the actual ingredients from the raw text.

## 🔄 The Pipeline

The ingredient extraction process follows a structured 8-step pipeline:

1. **Text Region Detection:** YOLO11n (custom trained on our dataset).
2. **ROI Extraction:** OpenCV Cropping using the bounding boxes predicted by YOLO.
3. **OCR Recognition:** PaddleOCR applied directly on each cropped region for accurate character transcription.
4. **OCR Text Aggregation:** Merging OCR lines into one cohesive paragraph per YOLO box.
5. **Structured OCR Output:** Generating raw JSON containing the transcribed text.
6. **Ingredient Region Identification:** Using Llama 3.3 70B (via Groq API) to semantically identify the ingredients.
7. **Ingredient Extraction:** Rule-based / NLP extraction (next step).
8. **Final JSON Output:** Final structured data ready for Database / API / Export.

## 🛠️ Discussing the Pipeline

Our pipeline was designed to handle the complexities of real-world product packaging through a carefully evaluated sequence of computer vision and NLP models.

### Dataset Preparation & Pre-processing
Detecting text on distorted and highly textured packaging requires a robust dataset. We manually annotated a custom dataset, eventually scaling it to hundreds of samples (Train: 259, Validation: 55, Test: 57). To optimize text visibility before detection, we evaluated various image pre-processing techniques, including Grayscale conversion, Blurring, CLAHE, OTSU, and Adaptive Thresholding.

### Model Selection: Why YOLO?
During the architectural design phase, we compared several object detection frameworks, including EasyOCR (using the CRAFT backbone) and Faster R-CNN.

While Faster R-CNN (a two-stage Region Proposal Network) provided slightly higher accuracy in some isolated cases, we ultimately selected **YOLO** because it is a fast, one-stage object detector that offers a much faster interface and state-of-the-art performance for real-time applications. To maximize efficiency without training from scratch, we utilized **Transfer Learning**—finetuning the pretrained features of the highly optimized **YOLOv11n** architecture on our specific text detection task.

*(Note: We also experimented with layer freezing during training, but found it did not significantly impact the final performance outcomes.)*

### End-to-End Integration
The complete pipeline bridges computer vision and natural language processing. Once YOLO isolates the text regions, the bounding boxes are cropped and passed to **PaddleOCR** for high-accuracy character transcription. Finally, this unstructured, aggregated text is fed into **Llama 3.3 (via the Groq API)**, which intelligently parses the raw string into a structured JSON list of ingredients.

## 📊 Results

Our model improved significantly as we scaled our dataset and transitioned from YOLOv8 to YOLO11n.

**Initial Training Results (111 images, YOLOv8n):**
- Precision: 0.636
- Recall: 0.698
- mAP50: 0.704
- mAP50-95: 0.483

**Final Training Results (YOLOv11n with 259 Train / 55 Val / 57 Test samples):**
- **Precision:** 0.8516 *(Out of all detected regions, 85% were actually text)*
- **Recall:** 0.7713 *(77% of all actual text was successfully detected)*
- **mAP50:** 0.8538 *(Mean Average Precision at IoU threshold ≥ 0.5)*
- **mAP50-95:** 0.6711 *(Average mAP across IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95)*
- **mAP75:** 0.7485
